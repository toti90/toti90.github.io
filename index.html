       <h3>Chemist and future Data Scientist</h3>
       <p>I had been working as a project leader chemist at a hungarian organization for three years. My long term goal is I want to learn programming and make some valuable work as a data scientist. </p>
       
       <p>I'm ambitous and enjoy challenges, but sometimes maybe a little impatient. I've been playing table tennis for almost 15 years, so I enjoy almost all ball games.</p>
